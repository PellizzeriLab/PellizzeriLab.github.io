# Research

**The Pellizzeri Group is actively recruiting undergraduate and graduate students.** Please contact Dr. Pellizzeri for more information.

The Pellizzeri Group uses the technique of computational chemistry, which uses the fundamental equations of physical chemistry and your chemical intuition to predict, explain, and model chemical processes on a computer, to answer research questions involving the research areas below. These projects can be tailored to the student's research interests and can range from application-based to model development or even coding.

**Research areas**:
* Computational discovery of materials for catalytic reactions
* Predicting reaction kinetics and thermodynamics of molecular transformations
* Designing materials for wastewater treatment
