We are a dynamic research group at Eastern Illinois University ([EIU Chemistry](https://www.eiu.edu/eiuchem/)). Our aim is to use quantum mechanical modeling to explore and understand small molecule catalysis, material properties and adsorptive materials for water treatment. (see [Research](research)).


We are grateful for funding from Eastern Illinois University, [EIU Chemistry](https://www.eiu.edu/eiuchem/)
